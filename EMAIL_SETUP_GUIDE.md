# Email Verification Setup Guide

## Current Status
✅ **Login Issue Fixed**: You can now sign in with your registered account  
✅ **Email Verification System**: Backend endpoints and frontend components are ready  
⚠️ **Email Configuration**: Needs email credentials to send verification emails  

## What's Working Now
1. **User Registration**: Works with temporary storage when database is not connected
2. **User Login**: Fixed to work with both database and temporary storage
3. **Email Verification System**: Complete backend API and frontend components created

## To Enable Email Verification

### Step 1: Get Email Credentials
You need to set up email service credentials. For Gmail:

1. Go to your Gmail account settings
2. Enable 2-factor authentication
3. Generate an "App Password" for this application
4. Use your Gmail address and the app password

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables
Edit the `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```

### Step 3: Restart the Backend Server
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart
npm start
```

## How Email Verification Works

1. **Registration**: User registers → automatic verification email sent
2. **Email Click**: User clicks verification link → redirects to `/verify-email?token=...`
3. **Verification**: Frontend calls backend to verify the token
4. **Success**: User redirected to login page

## Testing Email Verification

### Send Verification Email
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/auth/send-verification \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com"}'
```

### Verify Email Token
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/auth/verify-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"token":"verification-token-here"}'
```

## Alternative Email Services

### Using Other Email Services
You can use other SMTP services by updating the `.env` file:

```env
# For Outlook/Hotmail
EMAIL_HOST=smtp-mail.outlook.com
EMAIL_PORT=587

# For Yahoo
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.mail.yahoo.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
```

## Quick Test (Without Email Setup)
Even without email configuration, you can:
1. Register a new account
2. Login with the registered credentials
3. Access the dashboard

The email verification can be added later when you have email credentials ready.

## Files Created for Email Verification
- `routes/auth.js` - Added email verification endpoints
- `frontend/src/app/components/auth/email-verification/` - Complete email verification component
- `frontend/src/app/services/auth.service.ts` - Added email verification methods
- Updated app routing and module to include email verification

## Next Steps
1. Set up email credentials in `.env`
2. Restart backend server
3. Test complete email verification flow
4. Optional: Set up database connection for persistent storage
